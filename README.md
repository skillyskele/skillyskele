# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## Introduction
Hey there! üëã I'm **Nathan Kim**, and I'm passionate about **web development**, **cybersecurity**, and **electrical engineering**.

## Recent Project
üîç **Most Recent Project:** ARP Spoofing IoT Network
- **Description:** Built and ARP spoofed an IoT network, proposing a solution using network topology to mitigate risks.
- **Repository:** [IoT-Spring-2024](https://github.com/skillyskele/IoT-Spring-2024) contains writeup and IoT device code, and [hacking-scripts](https://github.com/skillyskele/Hacking-Scripts) contains spoofing script

## Where to Find My Stuff
üõ†Ô∏è **Repositories:**
- [hacking-scripts](https://github.com/skillyskele/Hacking-Scripts): Scripts and tools for cybersecurity, including:
  - Clearing Windows logs
  - Process injection techniques
  - ARP spoofing
  - And more!
- [Grocery-Tracking-App](https://github.com/skillyskele/Grocery-Tracking-App): MERN stack application for tracking groceries.
- [IoT-Spring-2024](https://github.com/skillyskele/IoT-Spring-2024): IoT Device and Agent code for my most recent project.
- In the [UIMA](https://github.com/jhu-cs-uima-sp24/TeamQ-Reminisce) repository, you can find code for a mobile app that I developed with my teammates!
- [SPC-Fall-2023](https://github.com/skillyskele/SPC-Fall-2023) has code for a mini CTF using openEMR source code that I made with my team. I contributed the XSS vulnerability!

## Electrical Engineering Projects
‚ö° **Electrical Engineering:** I haven't uploaded code here yet because they are for school homeworks, so uploading code wouldn't be academically ethical, but I'll be doing personal EE projects soon! Stay tuned for exciting personal EE projects!
