# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## Introduction
Hey there! üëã I'm **Nathan Kim**, and I'm passionate about **digital and analog circuit design**, **RTL development**, and **hardware acceleration**. 
## Recent Project
üîç **Most Recent Project:** Floating Point ADC
- **Description:** Designed a low-power floating-point analog-to-digital converter that takes analog current inputs and outputs their digital values in IEEE 754 formatting.
- **Repository:** [My code](https://github.com/skillyskele/floating_point_adc) models circuit behavior, and [my portfolio](https://skillyskele.github.io/portfolio/floating_point_adc.html) documents my work

## ‚ö° Electrical Engineering Projects

## üíª Computer Science/Cybersecurity Projects
- [hacking-scripts](https://github.com/skillyskele/Hacking-Scripts): Scripts and tools for cybersecurity, including:
  - Process Injection Techniques 
  - Clearing Windows logs
  - ARP spoofing
  - And more!
- [Grocery-Tracking-App](https://github.com/skillyskele/Grocery-Tracking-App): Every CS major tries making a website. Here's my MERN stack application for tracking groceries. Check out my [demo](https://odysee.com/Grocery-App-Demo:2?r=5iSZSmZ6TpMzscsfwmDPLXHT4nP7kNrN)
- [IoT-Spring-2024](https://github.com/skillyskele/IoT-Spring-2024): IoT application code; ARP spoofing vulnerability detection and writeup; most importantly, a [demo!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tszepjuEMvM)
- In the [UIMA](https://github.com/jhu-cs-uima-sp24/TeamQ-Reminisce) repository, you can find code for a mobile app that I developed with my teammates!
- [SPC-Fall-2023](https://github.com/skillyskele/SPC-Fall-2023) has code for a mini CTF using openEMR source code that I made with my team. I contributed the XSS vulnerability!
