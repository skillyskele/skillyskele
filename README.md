# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## Introduction
Hey there! üëã I'm **Nathan Kim**, and I'm passionate about **web development**, **cybersecurity**, and **electrical engineering**.

## Recent Project
üîç **Most Recent Project:** ARP Spoofing IoT Network
- **Description:** Built and ARP spoofed an IoT network, proposing a solution using network topology to mitigate risks.
- **Repository:** [IoT-Spring-2024](https://github.com/skillyskele/IoT-Spring-2024) contains writeup and IoT device code, and [hacking-scripts](https://github.com/skillyskele/Hacking-Scripts) contains spoofing script
